# Detecting 3D Hand Pointing Direction from RGB-D Data in Wide-Ranging HRI Scenarios

This repository contains data and codes for the paper __Stochastic Control and Pricing for Natural Gas Networks__ by Vladimir Dvorkin, Anubhav Ratha, Pierre Pinson, and Jalal Kazempour. The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03283). If you use this code or parts of it, please cite the paper.

## Abstract

## Installation
The optimization problems are implemented using [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) modeling language for mathematical optimization.

 [Ipopt](https://ipoptjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipopt.html) solver is used in the code, however, it may be changed with a QP solver when feasible.
